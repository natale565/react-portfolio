                      My name is Christopher Natale, and I am a results-driven professional with over 9 years of experience leading teams, exceeding sales goals, and driving business growth. I am transitioning into Software Development, where I can apply my strengths in problem-solving, leadership, and collaboration. My background in sales has honed my communication and project management skills, and I now combine these with my technical expertise in full-stack and front-end development. I have a passion for building responsive, user-friendly web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, and Node.js. Driven by a love for learning and innovation, I am excited to solve complex problems through creative, impactful digital solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to continuously growing in the tech industry, aiming to leverage both my business acumen and technical skills to make meaningful contributions.

                    Outside of my career, I am passionate about mental health and wellness, advocating for balance and self-care. I maintain an active lifestyle as a dedicated gym-goer and explore creativity through playing guitar and DJing. Lifelong learning has been a driving force in my career transition, and I am eager to apply my diverse experiences and skills in this new chapter. I am excited to blend my leadership and problem-solving abilities with my technical expertise to create user-centered applications that deliver real-world value.
